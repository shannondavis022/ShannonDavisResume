        <div class="subheading mb-5">ðŸ§  B.S. Psychology ðŸ”¬ Visual Cognition Research Assistant </div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Shannon Davis and I am a third year undergraduate student at University of California, Riverside. I was born and raised in Arcadia, California. I am currently majoring in Psychology on the B.S. track and hope to further my education by pursuing my Master's Degree in behavioral sciences and research. At this point in my degree, I am unsure of what particular field to declare my concentration as so many subfields and topics of research interest me within Psychology. However, currently I am leaning towards Consumer Behavior, Cognitive Neuroscience, or Personality. While I am deeply invested in my academics, I am also proud of my professional track record. I have a wide variety of work experience, while I have spent time as supervisor in the service industry I have currently transitioned to more administrative and research focused positions. On campus I work as a student lead at ASUCR and Glen Mor's RSO. I am also currently a member of Dr. Andersen's Visual Cognition and Human Performance Lab where I work as a student research assistant. <br><br>

        In my administrative positions as a student lead at both ASUCRâ€™s and Glen Morâ€™s offices I am given the unique and exciting opportunity to work closely with both professional staff, students, and other visitors to our campus. In these roles Iâ€™ve gained the knowledge and abilities to effectively communicate, solve problems, and collaborate within an office setting. Not only have I been accumulating administrative know-how but I have also had the opportunity to improve upon my interpersonal skills and customer service experience. These positions have given me the chance to learn more about myself and better understand my work ethic. I am now confident in my ability to find creative solutions, improve upon previous processes, start new tasks, and collaborate with a diverse group of individuals.<br><br>

       I believe because of these strengths and skills I was able to thrive in the Visual Cognition and Human Performance lab from day one. The visual cognition lab is concerned with understanding the perceptual, attentional, and cognitive limitations in the performance of complex perceptual tasks. This work has three primary directions. One direction is concerned with examining perceptual tasks associated with real-world applications, specifically driving performance, with a particular focus on predicting and preventing accident risk among older drivers. To address this issue we have conducted experiments examining a wide range of perceptual tasks (e.g., steering control, collision avoidance, visual search) using a custom driving simulator coded from scratch in our lab. Our current research is examining the effectiveness of cognitive, perceptual, and attentional measures as predictors for decreased driving skill for the elderly. The second direction is concerned with examining tasks associated with the perception of scenes. Our research on this issue has included examining limitations in attention in three-dimensional displays and the role of texture in the perception of objects in scenes. The third direction examines possible interventions to age-related perceptual declines. This work has examined perceptual learning for low-level, as well as high-level visual features. Our more recent work has examined age-related changes in multimodal integration and will soon examine perceptual learning in the context of multisensory As this was my first research position there was much I needed to learn and quickly. With a multitude of experimental equipment, computer programs, and data needing to be recorded and analyzed; there were high expectations of me so I learned duties, tasks, and processes quickly. With such a wide array of work, it was intimidating at first. But eventually I got more comfortable with the quick pace of the lab, I even found ways to improve data collection and participant scheduling. This role has given me priceless experience and insight into this world. Finally getting to see both sides of the same process is what pushed me to want to pursue a career in research and apply to grad school.
